I'm testing knitr_and_record. Can it find this Fancy Phrase?

How about these plots? horsepower is an interesting thing to study

```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)

p = qplot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$hp)
p
```


more text here again

```{r lm}

fit = lm(hp~wt, data = mtcars)
fit
```

Seems like horsepower is related to weight!
