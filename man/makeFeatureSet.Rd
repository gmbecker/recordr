\arguments{
\item{object}{The plot to summarize via metadata in an
ObjFeatureSet (or subclass)}

\item{...}{Other named arguments that become slots in the new
PlotFeatureSet.}
}
\value{
PlotFeatureSet S4 object containing a ObjFeatureSet object
    and extracted plot features
}
\description{
The generic function for transforming an R object into the
appropriate subclass of FeatureSet. This includes most introspection-based
metadata extraction from the object. Metadata extraction can be customized
at the package/R sesion level for specific classes of objects by
defining methods for this generic.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{ggplot}: Construct a ObjFeatureSet from an object of class ggplot.

\item \code{trellis}: Construct a ObjFeatureSet from an object of class trellis.

\item \code{gTree}: Construct a ObjFeatureSet from an object of class gTree.

\item \code{recordedplot}: Construct a ObjFeatureSet from an object of class recordedplot.

\item \code{expression}: Construct a ObjFeatureSet from an unevaluated expression.

\item \code{call}: Construct a ObjFeatureSet from a call.

\item \code{FeatureSet}: No-op if we already have a ObjFeatureSet

\item \code{ANY}: Catch-all for attempted construction of a ObjFeatureSet from an object not of class ggplot or trellis.

\item \code{data.frame}: Construct a DFFeatureSet from a data.frame
}}
